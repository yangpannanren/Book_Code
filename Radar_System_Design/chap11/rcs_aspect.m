function [rcs] = rcs_aspect(scat_spacing, freq)
% This function demonstrates the effect of aspect angle on RCS
% The default frequency is 3GHz. The radar is observing two unity 
% point scatterers separated by 1.0 meters. Initially the two scatterers
% are aligned with radar line of sight. The aspect angle is changed from
% 0 degrees to 180 degress and the equivalant RCS is computed.
% The RCS as measured by the radar versus aspect angle is then plotted.

% Users may vary frequency, and/or scatteres spacing to observe RCS variation
